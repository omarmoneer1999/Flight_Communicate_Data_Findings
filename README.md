The dataset has 29 columns
and 7009728 entries
The features Data types in the dataset are: float64(14), int64(10), object(5)

## Summary of Findings

After working on the univariate analysis we found that the biggest number of flights starts from WN and the least one is AQ.
And the biggest week day in flights number is Tuesday
The ratio of cancelled flights is 1.96% and the non-cancelled is 98.04%

And if we looked into the piechart that provided in the end of the analysis we will notice that the cancelled flights because of the NAS is the least ratio with .13%


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The second minor Delay factor is weather with ratio 5.3% and I think the reason was that the weather is stable that won't made the flights be delayed or cancelled.
